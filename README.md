# README

This is one of my portfolio projects. It involves a command line game inspired version of Hangman, where it uses the names of minerals instead of a dictionary.

This game includes:
- 1.600 different minerals to test your inner geologist.
- A nicely colored command line interface with nostalgic beep sounds.
- A level system to reach new ranks the more you play.
- A built in tutorial for new players.
- After a round of Hangman, the game offers you to show photos of the gemstone on Mindat.org.

The game is coded in Python, and then packaged into a EXE file.
To play the game, you can run that EXE file inside the zip folder.
